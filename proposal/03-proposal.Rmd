# The proposal
<!--
This is where the proposal should be outlined. 
-->

We propose to develop a package that would implement an R Shiny based interface, connecting database of companies (such as MySQL) with R packages and allow users work with the system in an interactive way. The system should be self sufficient and focus on the forecasting side of the business processes. It would allow analysing selected time series and producing forecasts with focuses on specific managerial decisions.

The system itself should be developed in three stages, this proposal outlines only the first of them.

## Overview
<!--
At a high-level address what your proposal is and how it will address the problem identified. Highlight any benefits to the R Community that follow from solving the problem. This should be your most compelling section.
-->
The Open Forecast Support System (OFSS) will have two main components:

1. The core, including the main functions for time series analysis and forecasting;
2. The interface, accessible via a local area network by users that have necessary privileges.

The system will need to be installed on a stand-alone server, but may also be installed on any computer that has R Shiny server.

The package will be freely available, and any member of the R community would be able to download and set it up for their purposes. Furthermore, the created interface can be adjusted for the needs of any company.
